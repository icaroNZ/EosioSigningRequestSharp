# EOSIO Request Signing Sharp
Connects with EOSIO Signing Request (ESR) protocol library. The full specification for ESR (Revision 3) is available [here](https://github.com/eosio-eps/EEPs/blob/master/EEPS/eep-7.md).

The ESR protocol allows for an application (dapp) to generate signature requests (transactions) which can then be passed to signers (wallets) for signature creation. These signature requests can be used within URI links, QR Codes, or other transports between applications and signers.

This is a Submodule of [AnchorLinkSharp](https://github.com/liquiidio/AnchorLinkSharp). Please follow the Instructions in the AnchorLinkSharp Repository.
